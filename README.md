# gulp-es6

This is a simple boilerplate for static sites, React projects, and using ES6.  It uses Gulp for HTML and CSS compilation, and Webpack for JavaScript minification and bundling.

## Usage

1. Install node modules.
  ```js
    $ npm install
  ```
  
2. Install Bower components.
  ```js
    $ bower install
  ```
  
3. Run Gulp to compile HTML and CSS.
  ```js
    $ gulp
  ```
  
4. Run Webpack to compile JavaScript (in a new tab).
  ```js
    $ npm run webpack
  ```

  ### Using Webpack Developer Server
    ```js
      $ npm run dev
    ```

  ### Compiling Production Code
    ```js
      $ npm run production
    ```
